Did your granny say listen to your heart  8  12  *
Be who you are on the inside  7  11
I need three words to tear her argument apart  9  15  *
Your granny lied!  3  5
I'd rather be  3  4
Shiny  1  1
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck  8  15
SCRUB THE DECK AND MAKE IT LOOK  7  9
Shiny  1  1
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck  8  12
Just a sec!  3  3
